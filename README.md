# embertext

ARCHIVE LOG: PARTIAL RECOVERY
SOURCE: UNKNOWN
INTEGRITY: DEGRADED

---

They kept adding layers.

Panels that spoke when no one asked.
Assistants that guessed instead of listened.
Editors that wanted attention more than the work.

So someone stopped.

They took the core, the part that actually understood code, and stripped everything else away.

No voices.
No popups.
No systems waking up in the background.

Just text.
And the intelligence beneath it.

---

**embertext** is a minimal code editor built on Monaco.

It does not predict you.
It does not interrupt you.

It exists to stay out of the way.

---

There is no marketplace.
There is no chat.
There is no feed.

Integrations are written, not installed.
Features are added deliberately, or not at all.

The editor does not grow on its own.

---

Status: early construction.
The core is live.
Language intelligence is present.
More layers may be added...carefully.

Some records are missing.
That is intentional.

---

If you are reading this,
the editor is already doing its job.
